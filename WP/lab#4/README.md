# Windows Programming Laboratory Work 3

## Title
Windows Timer. Animation.

## Implemented Tasks
I did the laboratory work in Code::Blocks 13.12 IDE.

- Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from keebord 
- Solve flicking problem 
- Add animated objects which will interact with each other
- Add balls with mouse
- Objects change color on interaction with each other
- On interaction with the right and left wall balls transform into squares
- On interaction with the top and bottom of the window increases the speed
    
###Conclusions
During this laboratory work I learned about animation and how to use the timer. I discovered things like the ickering problem and I learned how to solve it. Also, I got knowldge about making objects in an animation to interact with each other.

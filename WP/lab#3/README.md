# Windows Programming Laboratory Work 3

## Title
Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

## Implemented Tasks
I did the laboratory work in Code::Blocks 13.12 IDE.

**_Basic Level_**
- Draw 5 lines of different colors and weights
- Draw 2 Bezier curves 
- Draw 2 Bezier curves
- Draw 2 different objects using mouse

**_Normal Level_**
- Draw a custom bitmap image 
- Fill 2 object with gradient
- Hook keyboard input. Add 2 different keyboard combinations that will change mouse ability to draw objects (ex. on Ctrl+C will draw circles, on Alt+R will continue to draw circles but of read color)
- Draw a Bezier curve using mouse
    
**_Advanced Level_**
- Use mouse as an eraser with adjustable width

**_Additional Tasks_**
- Added 1 button for clearing the drawing area

## Conclusions
During this laboratory work I learned During this laboratory work I learned about basic drawing and how to use the mouse. For me this laboratory work was harder and more complex than the first one.

In my opinion, it went a lot more in depth, covering some more advanced
topics. It was challenging to complete all the tasks and I really enjoyed implementing them. I think
that there are is a little bit space for improvements, and I'll use them in the future. The laboratory
work broadened and deepened my understanding of Event-Driven Programming, message-sending,
and Win32 API in particular.

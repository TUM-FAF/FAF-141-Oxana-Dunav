# Windows Programming Laboratory Work 3

## Title
Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

## Implemented Tasks
I did the laboratory work in Code::Blocks 13.12 IDE.

**_Basic Level_**
- Draw 5 lines of different colors and weights
- Draw 2 Bezier curves 
- Draw 2 Bezier curves
- Draw 2 different objects using mouse

**_Normal Level_**
- Draw a custom bitmap image 
- Fill 2 object with gradient
- Hook keyboard input. Add 2 different keyboard combinations that will change mouse ability to draw objects (ex. on Ctrl+C will draw circles, on Alt+R will continue to draw circles but of read color)
- Draw a Bezier curve using mouse
    
**_Advanced Level_**
- Use mouse as an eraser with adjustable width

**_Additional Tasks_**
- Added 1 button for clearing the drawing area

## Features
- I've structured my tools into 3 groupboxes: Tools/Shapes, Color Properties, Width Properties
- <b>Pencil</b> will draw a continuous line with the stroke weight equal to 1, and the selectable stroke
color and weight by selecting this tool, and left-clicking on the drawing area.
- <b>Line</b> will draw a straight line between two points, with the selectable stroke weight and color
by dragging and releasing the mouse button.
- <b>Bezier curve.</b> You can draw Bezier curve using mouse, by clicking and dragging two times.
- <b>Rectangle</b> will draw a rectangle, with selectable stroke weight and color, lled with a selectable
color, or not, by dragging and releasing the mouse button.
- <b>Ellipse</b> will draw an ellipse, with selectable stroke weight and color, lled with a selectable
color, or not, by dragging and releasing the mouse button.
- <b>Eraser</b> will erase the drawing area, with a selectable weight.
- <b>Clear</b> button will clear the whole drawing area.
- By pressing <b>CTRL + E</b> you select ellipse for drawing.
- By pressing <b>CTRL + C</b> you select blue color for drawing

###Conclusions
During this laboratory work I learned During this laboratory work I learned about basic drawing and how to use the mouse. For me this laboratory work was harder and more complex than the first one.

In my opinion, it went a lot more in depth, covering some more advanced
topics. It was challenging to complete all the tasks and I really enjoyed implementing them. I think
that there are is a little bit space for improvements, and I'll use them in the future. The laboratory
work broadened and deepened my understanding of Event-Driven Programming, message-sending,
and Win32 API in particular.

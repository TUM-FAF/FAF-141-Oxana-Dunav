# Windows Programming Laboratory work 2

## Title
Advanced Form Elements. Child Windowses. Basics of Working With Keyboard.

## Implemented Tasks
I did the laboratory work in Code::Blocks 13.12 IDE.

**_Basic Level_**
- Create a Windows application that will display a dialog box on some event
- Add a system menu to your application with at least 3 items 
- Hook keyboard input. Add 2 custom events for 2 different keyboard combinations 

**_Normal Level_**
- Add a scroll bar that will change any visible parameter of any other element (color of a text) OR other 2 scroll bars that will manage main window size or position
    
**_Advanced Level_**
- Customize your application by adding an icon and using different cursor in application
- Add a listbox and attach some events when any element is accessed (clicked)

**_Bonus Point Tasks_**
- Use a scroll bar to scroll through application working space. Scroll should appear only when necessary

## Features
- You can add a new item by writing the item in the box next to the Add button and then press
<b>Add</b>.
- You can move through the elements of the list using <b>Shift + Up</b> and <b>Shift + Down</b>
- You can delete an element from the listbox by selecting it and pressing <b>Remove</b> button.
- By clicking <b>Clear</b> button, the listbox is cleared(all elements are deleted).
- Using the <b>Color</b> scrollbar, you can change the color of the text of the element that is in the
insert box(next to the the Add button).
- Using the <b>Window Width</b> scrollbar, you can change the width of the window.
- Using the <b>Window Height</b> scrollbar, you can change the height of the window.
- By pressing <b>CTRL + Q</b> you exit from the program.
- By pressing <b>CTRL + I</b> there appears a dialog box.
- You can also exit from the program, see the dialog box and clear the data from the listbox by accesing the menu.
- A vertical and horizontal scrollbar appears when necessary

### Conclusions
During this laboratory work I learned how to add a menu, use resources, how to use a dialog
box and the keyboard. For me this laboratory work was harder and more complex than the first one.

In my opinion, it went a lot more in depth, covering some more advanced
topics. It was challenging to complete all the tasks and I really enjoyed implementing them. I think
that there are is a little bit space for improvements, and I'll use them in the future. The laboratory
work broadened and deepened my understanding of Event-Driven Programming, message-sending,
and Win32 API in particular.
